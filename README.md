# Problem Set 1

- [x] Submitted?

_Please insert an x in the square brackets above to mark the assignment as submitted!_


## Instructions:
The pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines.
- [x] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the file called `Prob1.py` in the repository. This is another Karel program and has additional worlds called `1x8.w`, `5x5.w`, `5x3.w`, and `8x1.w`. 
- [x] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the file called `Prob2.py`. The template is very sparse here on purpose, as you are defining the desired functions.
- [x] Code for Problem 3 should be done in `Prob3.py`! The template here just has a single function that you should add your code to.

Please remember to fill out the meta-information at the top of each file! At the very least, be clear about if you worked with anyone.

If you have issues or come across problems or parts of the instructions that are unclear, please don't hesitate to ask on Discord or via Campuswire or email or in person!


#### Testing:
Many problem set questions over the semester will have some auto-testing functionality built into them. For those that do, when you commit new material to your repository, a sequence of tests will be run against your code to see if it is meeting all the desired requirements. If you get a green checkmark, it means that _everything tested_ is passing and you should be good to go! I still always look at all the code in person, so if an auto-test is ever failing for some silly reason, you should know that I'll look and score your code myself, not the auto-test. The auto-tests are just there to give you some confidence that you are doing things correctly.

I can not easily write auto-tests for Karel programs, but Problems 2 and 3 of this assignment have auto-tests included, and thus any green checkmark or red X you see will be telling you about how those problems went. I'll have an example in class or lab to demonstrate how you can get more information from the test.
